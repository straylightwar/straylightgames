  <h3>Turn Sequence</h3>

	<p>Any beginning of turn map specific events take place, such as spawning characters.</p>
	<p>Next the beginning of each turn, all players roll their speed (blue) dice and total their values to see who moves first. </p>

  <div class="imagecontainer">

  </div>

	<p>Ties are broken by rolling speed (blue) dice again.</p>
	<p>Characters may opt to move and take actions later than the order they rolled, but not earlier.</p>
	<p>Characters then move and take actions, interact with obstacles, and resolve combat in any or mixed order.</p>
	<p>Any end of turn map sequences take place, such as refreshing objects.</p>
  
  <h3>Actions</h3>
  <h4>Melee Combat</h4>
  
  <p>When two or more units are adjacent, they may choose to block one another's movement and engage in melee combat with the other--
this cannot be prevented except by defeating the other player(s) or by modification cards.</p>

  <div class="imagecontainer">
 <div class="img"> <img src="images\figures\3-1.png" alt="Melee Combat Range"></div>
  </div>
  
  <p>An attacking player chooses a target and rolls their offense (red) dice, ordering them from highest to lowest</p>
  
  <div class="imagecontainer">
  <div class="img"><img src="images\figures\3-2.png" alt="Rolling for Melee Combat"></div>
  <div class="img"><img src="images\figures\3-3.png" alt="Adjusting Offensive Roll"></div>
  </div>
  
  <p>The defending player then rolls their defense (black) dice, ordering them from highest to lowest.</p>
  
  <div class="imagecontainer">
  <div class="img"><img src="images\figures\3-4.png" alt="Rolling for Defense"></div>
  <div class="img"><img src="images\figures\3-5.png" alt="Adjusting Defensive Roll"></div>
  </div>
  
  <p>The reordered dice are then compared, attacks rolled higher than defense dice are successful and defense rolled equal or higher than attacks are successful.</p>
  
  <div class="imagecontainer">
  <img src="images\figures\3-6.png" width="512" height="256" alt="Success Examples">
  </div>
  
  <p>If the amount of attack dice is higher than the amount of defense dice, they must roll 3 or higher to be successful.</p>
  
  <div class="imagecontainer">
  <img src="images\figures\3-7.png" width="512" height="256" alt="Success Examples with Unopposed Dice">
  </div>
  
  <p>Multiple characters can also be targeted by splitting the amount of dice rolled between each target, or by modification cards. </p>
  
  <div class="imagecontainer">

  </div>
  
  <h4>Ranged Combat</h4>
  <p>Attacking players at a distance is accomplished the same way as melee combat except for a few differences for the attacker.</p>
  <p>Ranged attacks must have an unobstructed path to the target, unless otherwise modified.</p>
  
  <div class="imagecontainer">
 <div class="img"><img src="images\figures\image_placeholder.png" alt=""></div>
 <div class="img"><img src="images\figures\image_placeholder.png" alt=""></div>
  </div>
  
  <p>Range is determined by the amount of attack dice for each tile beyond melee range, and that die is subtracted from the attack roll.</p>
  <p>For example, a character with 5 offense (red) dice, can attack up to 4 tiles away, using the last die to attack with.</p>

  <p>Multiple characters can also be targeted by splitting the amount of dice rolled between each target, or by modification cards.</p>
  
  <div class="imagecontainer">
  <div class="img"><img src="images\figures\image_placeholder.png" alt=""></div>
  </div>
  
  <h4>Damage</h4>  
  <p>Damage from successful hits is subtracted from a player's dice pool (Speed, Offense, or Defense).</p>
  
  <div class="imagecontainer">
  <div class="img"><img src="images\figures\image_placeholder.png" alt=""></div>
  </div>
  
  <p>The set subtracted from is the damaged player's choice, unless modified otherwise.</p>
  <p>A player must maintain at least 1 die in each pool, or they are injured and disabled.</p>
  <p>If a character loses all of their dice in their dice pool, they are destroyed.</p>
  <p>Advanced Play: Instead of being injured, dice pools with zero in them can just disable that specific trait (Speed, Offense, or Defense) until the player is destroyed.</p>
